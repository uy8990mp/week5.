            Before joining my undergraduate study, I was planning to do my bachelorâ€™s in medicine and medical science as I was a biology student and was very much interested in human biology. After my high school, I was preparing for the medical entrance examination. I was also interested Information Technology. So, I was also applying for the visa to study Information Technology in the USA. I was granted the visa to the USA and I joined Minnesota State University as it is one of the affordable schools which provides quality education in the field of Information Technology.

            After I joined my university, I was not quite sure about the field of specialization as I was a biology student. However, I was fascinated by the study of database management and administration and network security as these are the emerging aspects of Information Technology. So, I decided to complete my certification in Database Management and Administration and Information Security.
